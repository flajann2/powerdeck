* My personal notes for streamdeck-ui-hs
  These are my personal notes for this
  project. They are not promised to be
  uptodate or even accurate. They are only
  intended for myself and no one else.

  You may find something useful here, but it is not gauranteed.

** Goals
   + To be better than the Python version of the same for Linux
   + To be more on a par with the Windows supported version
   + To allow operation across multiple login accounts
   + To allow for better management of the keys and their icons.

** Strategy
   We want to rely on a FRP framework. We must select one to best
   suit our needs. Then the rest will flow.
