** Introduction
   Streamdeck is a capable device, and the support for Linux
   is simply not there. There is a Python version of the same
   available, but limited in its capabilities... and buggy.

   I wish to strike out in a new direction for supporting
   Streamdeck, to be more on a par with some of the functionality
   available for it under Windows, at least, and beyond.
